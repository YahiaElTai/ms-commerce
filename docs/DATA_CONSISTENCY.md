### Data consistency

There are generally 2 approaches to ensure data consistency across microservices:

1.  **Distributed transactions**

    In a distributed transaction, transactions are executed on two or more resources (e.g. databases, message queues). Data integrity is guaranteed across multiple databases by distributed transaction manager or coordinator.

2.  **Eventual consistency**

    Eventual consistency is a model used in distributed systems to achieve high availability. In an eventual consistent system, inconsistencies are allowed for a short time until solving the problem of distributed data.

    This model doesnâ€™t apply to distributed ACID transactions across microservices. Eventual consistency uses the BASE database model.

The approach selected for this project: **Eventual consistency**

Eventual consistency can be achieved using the Materialized View Pattern with event based communication via Cloud Pub/Sub.

A materialized view is a read-only representation of the source data in a format that best serves that specific microservice.

This approach ensures loose coupling between microservices at the trade-off of eventual consistency and data duplication.

**Example Flow**

- A POST request is sent to the cart service to create a new cart.
- The cart service creates the cart and stores it in its own database and then sends an event `cart_created` containing JSON of the new cart with all its fields.
- This event is sent via Cloud Pub/Sub to a specific topic `cart_created`, the later can have many subscribers for example the order service and the customer service need to know when a new cart is created.
- Each service that cares about `cart_created` event subscribes to that topic and creates a handler to receive incoming events from that topic.
- A handler's responsibility is to ensure data is synchronized between its local version and the source data (cart service) by duplicating the data.
- The services that care about the `cart` data never updates its own local version of the data since it's read-only but only updates it when it receives events.

The above flow ensures that the `cart` data is (eventually) consistent across all microservices that cares about it.
